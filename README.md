# Rebound
3D Game made using Unreal Engine.

# How The Game Works
The player has to shoot as many balls as they can without getting hit by them. 
The balls have projective physics and can bounce off of collisions, hence the name 'Rebound'.
If the player gets hit by a ball, the game resets.
# Plans For The Project
So far I was able to display a count for the number of balls shot per game, although this is displayed on a terminal in the top left. I would like to implement a more visually appealing HUD in the future, and also a menu interface which lets the player see what their score was after they get hit, instead of restarting straight away.
